# FLAN-T5 LoRA for BioLaySumm Expert-to-Layperson Translation

**Author:** Nathan Chung  
**Course:** COMP3710 Pattern Analysis  
**Difficulty:** Hard  

## Overview

This project implements a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) on FLAN-T5 to translate expert radiology reports into layperson-friendly summaries. The system addresses the critical need for medical communication accessibility by converting complex medical terminology into plain language that patients can understand.

## Problem Statement

Medical radiology reports are written in technical language that is often incomprehensible to patients. This creates barriers to patient understanding and engagement with their own healthcare. This project tackles **Subtask 2.1 of the ACL 2025 BioLaySumm workshop**, which focuses on translating expert radiology reports into layperson summaries.

## Dataset

### BioLaySumm Dataset

**Source:** [BioLaySumm/BioLaySumm2025-LaymanRRG-opensource-track](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BioLaySumm/BioLaySumm2025-LaymanRRG-opensource-track)

**Description:** The BioLaySumm dataset contains expert radiology reports paired with layperson summaries, specifically designed for medical text simplification tasks.

**Dataset Statistics:**
- **Total samples:** 170,991
- **Training split:** 150,454 samples
- **Validation split:** 10,000 samples  
- **Test split:** 10,537 samples
- **Source:** Primarily PadChest dataset (77.7% of samples)

**Data Format:**
```json
{
  "radiology_report": "No infiltrates or consolidations are observed in the study.",
  "layman_report": "The study did not show any signs of lung infections or areas of lung tissue replacement.",
  "source": "PadChest",
  "images_path": "216840111366964013076187734852011201090749220_00-141-160.png"
}
```

### Split Policy

**Train/Validation/Test Split:**
- **Training (87.9%):** Used for model fine-tuning with LoRA
- **Validation (5.8%):** Used for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping
- **Test (6.2%):** Held-out for final evaluation only

**Reproducibility:**
- Fixed random seed (42) for consistent shuffling
- Deterministic data loading across runs
- Stable train/val/test splits maintained

### PHI (Protected Health Information) Handling

**Privacy Considerations:**
- Dataset contains de-identified radiology reports
- No direct patient identifiers in the text
- Image paths are anonymized (numeric identifiers only)
- Original dataset creators have handled PHI removal

**Our Implementation:**
- No additional PHI processing required
- Dataset is already compliant for research use
- Focus on text translation without storing sensitive information
- All processing done on de-identified data

## Model Architecture

- **Model:** `google/flan-t5-base`
- **Parameters:** ~248M parameters
- **Architecture:** Encoder-decoder transformer
- **Context Length:** 512 tokens
- **Pre-training:** Instruction-tuned for better few-shot performance

### LoRA Configuration
- **Rank (r):** 8 - Low-rank adaptation dimension
- **Alpha:** 32 - LoRA scaling parameter (alpha/r = 4.0)
- **Dropout:** 0.1 - Regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Target Modules:** Query (q), Value (v) projections
- **Task Type:** Sequence-to-sequence language modeling

## Results and Performance

### Final Performance Results

| Model | ROUGE-1 | ROUGE-2 | ROUGE-L | ROUGE-Lsum | Training Strategy |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|------------|------------------|
| **Zero-shot Baseline** | 0.317 | 0.116 | 0.287 | 0.287 | No training |
| **T5-small Full FT** | 0.444 | 0.230 | 0.397 | 0.397 | Full fine-tuning |
| **FLAN-T5-base LoRA** | **0.696** | **0.496** | **0.640** | **0.640** | LoRA adaptation |

**Note on ROUGE-L vs ROUGE-Lsum:** We report identical values because our evaluation computes ROUGE on plain text without splitting into sentences. In Hugging Face `evaluate`, ROUGE-Lsum expects sentences separated by newline characters to apply sentence level aggregation. Since our references and predictions are single strings, ROUGE-Lsum reduces to ROUGE-L. This is a common implementation choice and not a calculation error.

If newline splitting is applied, ROUGE-Lsum may differ slightly. We prioritised the plain text variant for simplicity and consistency with prior work.

### Key Findings
- **FLAN-T5 LoRA achieves 69.6% ROUGE-1** - significantly outperforming both baselines
- **+37.9 points improvement** over zero-shot baseline
- **+25.2 points improvement** over T5-small full fine-tuning
- **LoRA efficiency:** Only 0.36% trainable parameters (885K out of 248M) with superior performance

### Model Efficiency
- **FLAN-T5 LoRA:** 885K trainable parameters (0.36% of 248M total)
- **T5-small Full FT:** 60M trainable parameters (100% of 60M total)
- **Training Memory:** ~12GB VRAM (LoRA) vs ~6GB VRAM (Full FT with gradient checkpointing)
- **Inference Speed:** ~50ms per report on A100 GPU

## Representative Examples

### Example 1: Excellent Translation (ROUGE-1: 0.875)
**Input:** "Chronic pulmonary changes"  
**Target:** "Long-term changes in the lungs are seen."  
**Generated:** "Long-term changes in the lungs are present."  
**Analysis:** Perfect translation with high ROUGE scores. Model correctly simplified medical terminology while maintaining meaning.

### Example 2: Very Good Translation (ROUGE-1: 0.824)
**Input:** "Central venous catheter traversing the left jugular vein with its tip in the superior vena cava. The remainder is unchanged."  
**Target:** "A central venous catheter is going through the left jugular vein and its tip is in the superior vena cava. Everything else is the same as before."  
**Generated:** "A central venous catheter is inserted through the left jugular vein with its tip in the superior vena cava. Everything else looks the same."  
**Analysis:** Excellent translation with minor word choice differences. Model successfully simplified complex medical terminology.

### Example 3: Good Translation (ROUGE-1: 0.701)
**Input:** "Radiological signs of air trapping, flattened diaphragm, and increased retrosternal space. Calcified pleural plaques at the level of the left diaphragmatic pleura..."  
**Target:** "The X-ray shows signs of trapped air, a flattened muscle under the lungs, and more space behind the breastbone. There are also hardened areas on the lung lining on the left side..."  
**Generated:** "The x-ray shows signs of air trapping, flattened diaphragm, and increased space behind the breastbone. There are calcium deposits in the pleura, which are the membranes around the lungs..."  
**Analysis:** Good translation of complex medical report. Model handles technical terms well but shows some minor differences in phrasing.

### Example 4: Challenging Case (ROUGE-1: 0.511)
**Input:** "Calcification of the anterior longitudinal vertebral ligament with morphology suggestive of changes related to diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis..."  
**Target:** "The patient has calcium deposits in the ligament that runs along the spine, which is a sign of a condition called diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis..."  
**Generated:** "The front leg ligament, which is the part of the spine that separates the chest from the abdomen, is calcified and looks like it might be due to a spread of idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis..."  
**Analysis:** Challenging case with complex medical terminology. Model struggles with rare conditions and produces some anatomical inaccuracies.

### Example 5: Perfect Match (ROUGE-1: 1.0)
**Input:** "Within normal limits."  
**Target:** "Normal."  
**Generated:** "Normal."  
**Analysis:** Perfect match for simple cases. Model correctly handles straightforward medical conclusions.

## Error Analysis

The FLAN-T5-base LoRA model significantly outperforms both baselines, achieving 69.6% ROUGE-1 compared to 44.4% for T5-small full fine-tuning and 31.7% for zero-shot. The zero-shot baseline primarily fails by copying input text verbatim instead of translating, while T5-small full fine-tuning shows moderate improvement but suffers from oversimplification and limited vocabulary. The FLAN-T5 LoRA model successfully balances medical accuracy with accessibility, though it occasionally struggles with complex medical conditions (10-15% of cases) and rare anatomical terminology (15-20% of complex cases). The superior performance of FLAN-T5 LoRA can be attributed to its instruction-tuning foundation, parameter-efficient adaptation preventing overfitting, and larger model scale providing better medical language understanding.

## Future Improvements

1. **Medical-Specific Metrics:** Integrate F1-CheXbert and F1-RadGraph
2. **Domain Adaptation:** Fine-tune on specific radiology subdomains
3. **Multi-modal:** Incorporate radiology images for better context
4. **Interactive Refinement:** Allow human feedback for summary improvement

```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **CUDA Out of Memory:**
   ```yaml
   # Reduce batch size in configs/train_flant5_base_lora.yaml
   training:
     batch_size: 4  # Reduce from 8
     gradient_accumulation_steps: 8  # Increase from 4
   ```

2. **CPU Training Too Slow:**
   ```yaml
   # Reduce dataset size for testing
   # Use smaller subset: dataset.select(range(1000))
   ```

3. **Import Errors:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure all dependencies installed
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Check Python version

```

**Evaluation on Cluster:**
```bash
# Run zero-shot baseline (untrained model)
sbatch scripts/slurm/eval_zeroshot_baseline.sbatch

# Evaluate trained models
sbatch scripts/slurm/eval_rouge.sbatch
sbatch scripts/slurm/eval_rogue_t5.sbatch

# Quick test with limited samples
sbatch --export=ALL,MAX_SAMPLES=1000 scripts/slurm/eval_zeroshot_baseline.sbatch
```

**Check Job Status:**
```bash
squeue -u $USER
```

### Next Steps

After training:
1. **Run zero-shot baseline** to establish pre-training performance
2. **Evaluate** the trained models on test set  
3. **Compare** baseline vs trained ROUGE scores
4. **Generate** sample expert-to-layperson translations
5. **Analyze** ROUGE metrics and training curves
6. **Fine-tune** hyperparameters if needed
